# Humanising Autonomy: Where are we going?
AV Principles aiding human centred design of autonomous vehicles

As seen in ustwo Auto's new book - http://ustwo.com/auto/humanisingautonomy/ .
Please feel free to add/modify or use these prinicples.

Throughout the research and writing of the book, we have unearthed a number of consistent and ubiquitous user-centred design considerations that we feel are vitally important in designing any user experience within and around an autonomous vehicle. These Human–AV Design Principles act as a guide to keep us creating the most inclusive and most appropriate user experience ensuring that the user gets the best possible journey from their ride. These are principles, not laws and so are subject to change and iteration. 

We would love to get feedback from you and we hope that you too will use these when you’re designing for the human, and not for the robot, in an autonomous journey future. 

01. HUMAN AUTONOMY IS THE GOAL
Ultimately we are creating autonomy for humans, not for the robots. Everything we design is for that human goal – you are not done when the robot is fully autonomous.

02. BUILD ON THE HERITAGE
The automotive industry is one of unique heritage with romantic notions of freedom and travelling to faraway lands. The passion for the automobile is well established and it’s heritage is unrivaled. Combining this heritage with the benefits of modern technology would be something we would love.

03. EMOTIONAL AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS
There’s more to a journey than simply the functional need to get from A to B. Any journey includes many human and emotional needs such as comfort and human interaction.

04. BUILD TRUST IN THE EXPERIENCE
Anxieties in new technology need to be alleviated for their early adoption and continued use. So build trust early and keep it going throughout the lifetime of experience.

05. BALANCE ANTHROPOMORPHIC PROJECTION
The anthropomorphic characteristics of an AV's exterior need to consider both the idea of a robotic car as a friend or creature, as well as a tool to make life better, so that it is not feared and treated with respect.
             
06. ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A HUMAN ROBOT RELATIONSHIP
If a stranger is rude to you, you won’t want to interact with them again. The same applies to a robot. The AV must acknowledge and reciprocate human manners and behaviours. For example, when a person waves to thank an AV for letting them cross the road, the AV must display acknowledgement of the gesture back to the human.

07. DEGRADE GRACEFULLY FOR THE SENSES
There should always be reasonable fallbacks for interactions, without overtly relying on any one interaction channel. For example, audio interactions for vision-impaired people should have visual counterparts for people who cannot hear or understand auditory information.

08. ACT HUMAN, BE ROBOT
Utilise both human and machine advantages by instilling the beneficial nuance of human behaviour while exploiting technological benefits ie quick response times of machines.

09. RESPECT FOR THE FAST METAL BOX
The AV does not need to be submissive to the actors it shares the road with, it just needs to convey an understanding of the situation. We feel that AVs need to be treated with the same respect as a person would treat any other vehicle or machine so that it can safely integrate with society.

10. COMMUNICATE CAPABILITIES
The user must understand the capabilities and failings of the AV so that they can either operate it appropriately, ride in fully-autonomous mode safely, or know when it is safe to enter autonomous mode.

11. REMOVE ALL LIABILITY FROM THE USER
Liability in case of an accident in AVs is ambiguous and confused. For users to truly adopt the technology, OEMs or service providers should accept liability in 100% of cases, removing that confusion.

12. THE AV SHOULD NOT ASSUME TOO MUCH
Prediction or assumption of human driving behavior and intention is a complex task. One that should not be relied upon in designing systems - so the AV should only speak for itself and it’s intentions, not others.

13. DON’T ASK, OBSERVE
People say one thing but do another – this disparity is human nature. In user testing or mining for insights, it's more accurate to observe what people do, rather than ask what they would do.

14. MITIGATE CONCERN EARLY
While the technology is earning trust, people will feel anxious using AVs. Continued sources of stress from the all-new experience of a driverless can can cause anxiety levels to rise. Anxieties left unmitigated may result in the anxiety “snowball effect”.

15. SOLVE PROBLEMS HOLISTICALLY
Consider the person’s needs and the full end-to-end user scenario even when designing for a small part of it. This will help to give the solution a more contextually appropriate design.

16. THE AV SHOULD TELL US IT UNDERSTANDS ITS SURROUNDINGS
It is important that people know what the AV see’s and that it understands where it is for them to trust it. An AV can also communicate an approaching hazard to vehicles behind it.

17. THE AV SHOULD TELL US WHAT IT IS GOING TO DO
While driving we communicate our intention to act ie by using indicators while turning or slowing down to let people cross. This should be the same for the AV so that the people interacting with it understand it. 

18. THE AV SHOULD RESPOND WHEN INTERACTED WITH
Feedback mechanisms are needed for people to know that the AV has seen or heard them, ie when being hailed, an AV should acknowledge the human interaction and respond.

19. UTILISE THE LANGUAGE OF PHYSICS
The laws of physics communicate an awful lot to us – in a language that we need not learn. We know, for example, that a moving object leaning right implies that the object will turn right.

20. THE AV IS INDEPENDENT AND NOT SUBMISSIVE
The AV needs to show that it understands the rules of the road and that it is a machine that is to be treated carefully and with respect. It should not be submissive to other actors of the road so that it is not bullied or tested or cause danger. 

21. THE AV SHOULD BE EMPATHETIC AND INCLUSIVE
People should feel independent and empowered around an AV irrespective of whether they have mobility issues or not. So affordances should be designed to enable people to feel respected and treated with discretion, ie the AV’s floor base lowering itself to allow any person to enter without aid. 

22. THE AV’S ACTIONS SHOULD BE RELIABLE AND REPEATABLE
When multiple channels of communication are involved, they should reinforce each other be consistent in their delivery. For instance, voice interactions as a person enters the vehicle should appear to come from the same source every time they use it. We can even repeat a greeting phrase just to put people at ease. 

23. BE PERSONAL
The user experience should be personal – the AV should adapt and monitor preferences, like seat position, steering wheel height, and monitor stress, etc.

24. THE AV SHOULD NOT TRY TO BE TOO SMART
If the AV tries to preempt human action all the time, it can cause anxieties as people feel they might not be in control. So prediction should be minimal and done with proper feedback.
